About Adonic project
====================

Adonic (Application Delivery and Optimizing Network Interoperability Controller) aims to be a secure, high-performance and flexible full-proxy server for Layer 3 - Layer 7 (in the `OSI model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model>`_).

It is written in `Python <http://python.org/>`_ with some parts using `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ for improved performance. While the emphasis is on security and performance (in that order) the intention is to make the code small, beautiful and comprehensible.

The code is in its early phase and participation and contributions are more than welcome.
